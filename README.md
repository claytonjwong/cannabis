### Week 2: Opioid Epidemic and Cannabis
#### Resources
* [What is the U.S. Opioid Epidemic?](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html)
    * In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted
    to opioid pain relievers and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates.
    * Increased prescription of opioid medications led to widespread misuse of both prescription
    and non-prescription opioids before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.
    * In 2017 HHS declared a [public health emergency](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/10/26/hhs-acting-secretary-declares-public-health-emergency-address-national-opioid-crisis.html) and announced a [5-Point Strategy To Combat the Opioid Crisis](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/speeches/2017-speeches/secretary-price-announces-hhs-strategy-for-fighting-opioid-crisis/index.html)
* [Understanding the Opioid Epidemic](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html)
    * Drug overdose deaths continue to increase in the United States.
    * From 1999 to 2017, more than 700,000 people have died from a drug overdose.
    * Around 68% of the more than 70,200 drug overdose deaths in 2017 involved an opioid.
    * In 2017, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids (including prescription opioids and illegal opioids like heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl) was 6 times higher than in 1999.
    * On average, 130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose.
* [Opioid Abuse Review](docs/opioid_abuse_review.pdf)
    * Chronic pain and prescription opioid abuse are extremely prevalent both in this country and worldwide. Consequences of opioid misuse can be life-threatening with significant morbidity and mortality, exacting a heavy toll on patients, physicians, and society. Individuals with chronic pain and co-occurring substance use disorders and/or mental health disorders, are at a higher risk for misuse of prescribed opioids. Opioid abuse and misuse occurs for a variety of reasons, including self-medication, use for reward, compulsive use because of addiction, and diversion for profit.

### Week 3: Obesity/Type 2 Diabetes, Sleep, and Cannabis
#### Resources
* [Adult Obesity Causes & Consequences](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/causes.html)
    * Obesity is a complex health issue to address. Obesity results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including individual factors such as behavior and genetics. Behaviors can include dietary patterns, physical activity, inactivity, medication use, and other exposures. Additional contributing factors in our society include the food and physical activity environment, education and skills, and food marketing and promotion. Obesity is a serious concern because it is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and the leading causes of death in the U.S. and worldwide, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.

## Course 4: 
### Week 1: Inflammation and the Microbiome
#### Resources
* [Microbes and Minds](docs/Microbes_and_Minds_2018.pdf)
    * In recent years, an extensive body of literature focused on the gut–brain axis and the possible role played by the gut microbiota in modulating brain morphology and function from birth to old age. Gut microbiota has been proposed as a relevant player during the early phases of neurodevelopment, with possible long-standing effects in later life. The reduction in gut microbiota diversity has also become one of the hallmarks of aging, and disturbances in its composition are associated with several (age-related) neurological conditions, including depression, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. Several pathways have been evoked for gut microbiota–brain communication, including neural connections (vagus nerve), circulating mediators derived by host-bacteria cometabolism, as well as the influence exerted by gut microbiota on host gut function, metabolism, and immune system. Although the most provoking data emerged from animal studies and despite the huge debate around the possible epiphenomenal nature of those findings, the gut microbiota–brain axis still remains a fascinating target to be exploited to attenuate some of the most burdensome consequences of aging.
* [Chronic Inflammation & Age-Associated Diseases](docs/Chronic_Inflammation.pdf)
    * Human aging is characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammation, and this phenomenon has been termed as “inflammaging.” Inflammaging is a highly significant risk factor for both morbidity and mortality in the elderly people, as most if not all age-related diseases share an inflammatory pathogenesis. Nevertheless, the precise etiology of inflammaging and its potential causal role in contributing to adverse health outcomes remain largely unknown. The identification of pathways that control age-related inflammation across multiple systems is therefore important in order to understand whether treatments that modulate inflammaging may be beneficial in old people. The session on inflammation of the Advances in Gerosciences meeting held at the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging in Bethesda on October 30 and 31, 2013 was aimed at defining these important unanswered questions about inflammaging. This article reports the main outcomes of this session.
