### Week 2: Opioid Epidemic and Cannabis
#### Resources
* [What is the U.S. Opioid Epidemic?](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html)
    * In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted
    to opioid pain relievers and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates.
    * Increased prescription of opioid medications led to widespread misuse of both prescription
    and non-prescription opioids before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.
    * In 2017 HHS declared a [public health emergency](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/10/26/hhs-acting-secretary-declares-public-health-emergency-address-national-opioid-crisis.html) and announced a [5-Point Strategy To Combat the Opioid Crisis](https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/speeches/2017-speeches/secretary-price-announces-hhs-strategy-for-fighting-opioid-crisis/index.html)
* [Understanding the Opioid Epidemic](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html)
    * Drug overdose deaths continue to increase in the United States.
    * From 1999 to 2017, more than 700,000 people have died from a drug overdose.
    * Around 68% of the more than 70,200 drug overdose deaths in 2017 involved an opioid.
    * In 2017, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids (including prescription opioids and illegal opioids like heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl) was 6 times higher than in 1999.
    * On average, 130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose.
* [Opioid Abuse Review](docs/opioid_abuse_review.pdf)
    * Chronic pain and prescription opioid abuse are extremely prevalent both in this country and worldwide. Consequences of opioid misuse can be life-threatening with significant morbidity and mortality, exacting a heavy toll on patients, physicians, and society. Individuals with chronic pain and co-occurring substance use disorders and/or mental health disorders, are at a higher risk for misuse of prescribed opioids. Opioid abuse and misuse occurs for a variety of reasons, including self-medication, use for reward, compulsive use because of addiction, and diversion for profit.

### Week 3: Obesity/Type 2 Diabetes, Sleep, and Cannabis
#### Resources
* [Adult Obesity Causes & Consequences](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/causes.html)
    * Obesity is a complex health issue to address. Obesity results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including individual factors such as behavior and genetics. Behaviors can include dietary patterns, physical activity, inactivity, medication use, and other exposures. Additional contributing factors in our society include the food and physical activity environment, education and skills, and food marketing and promotion. Obesity is a serious concern because it is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and the leading causes of death in the U.S. and worldwide, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer.
